      <p> Dear Ash,</p>
      <p> 
      <p>A very happy birthday to you.</p> 
      <p>I wish you, all the happiness in the world. </p>
      <p>I feel so fortunate that you are in my life - a most wonderful thing to transpire. Settlers of Catan. Fam events. Tech breakdowns. Too many coffee runs ($$). Vodka. You are a wonderful teacher, friend and relative. </p>
      <p> Your ability to inspire others, to drive change + be passionate about the things / projects you undertake - it is really pretty spesh. [hug]. Much love st-Uncle. x Erica </p>
